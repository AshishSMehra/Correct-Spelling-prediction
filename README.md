# Correct Spelling Prediction
This project aims to predict and correct spelling errors in a given text using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning models, the system can suggest the most likely correct spellings for misspelled words in real-time.

## Overview
Correct Spelling Prediction is designed to help users automatically detect and correct spelling mistakes. The model is trained on a large corpus of text, allowing it to learn the context of words and suggest the most appropriate corrections. This is particularly useful for text editors, chatbots, and word processing applications.

## Features
* Predicts and corrects spelling mistakes in real-time.
* Uses a deep learning model (LSTM/GRU-based architecture) for word prediction.
* Can handle out-of-vocabulary words and suggest the closest known correct spelling.
* Context-aware predictions based on surrounding words.
* Easy integration with other applications via a REST API (optional).

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Correct-Spelling-Prediction.git
    cd Correct-Spelling-Prediction

2. Install the required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Ensure you have the necessary NLP resources from nltk (if required):
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('wordnet')

## Usage
1. Run the Prediction Script:
You can run the prediction script on sample text using the command:
python predict.py --input "Ths is an exmple text"

The model will output corrected text:
Output: "This is an example text"

2. REST API (Optional):
To serve the model as an API, you can use Flask (ensure Flask is installed):
python app.py
This will start the application, and you can make POST requests to http://localhost:5000/predict with input text to get the corrected output.

## Model Details
* Architecture: The model is based on an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network, ideal for sequence prediction tasks like spelling correction.
* Training: The model was trained on a large text corpus with simulated spelling mistakes to learn how to predict the correct words.
* Evaluation: The model was evaluated using standard NLP metrics like accuracy and BLEU score to ensure high-quality predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains a combination of:
* Wikipedia Corpus: Pre-processed text from Wikipedia articles.
* Simulated Typos: Generated synthetic spelling errors to train the model to recognize and correct common mistakes.
You can access the dataset from [link-to-dataset] or generate your own by introducing random noise into a clean text dataset.

## Results
The model achieved the following results:
* Accuracy: 92.3%
* BLEU Score: 0.88
These metrics indicate the model's effectiveness in predicting the correct spelling in a wide range of contexts.

## Future Improvements
* Context-Awareness: Further training to improve understanding of complex sentence structures.
* Custom Dictionary Support: Allow users to add their own vocabulary for specialized domain-specific corrections.
* Performance Optimization: Speed up prediction times for real-time applications.
